It is also designed to attempt to process it film at a time - no parallel processing, just old fashioned 'line at a time' output. Looks great when you set it going in a terminal :)\r\n\r\n### The Game\r\nIf you've never heard of it, the Kevin Bacon game comes from a phrase once uttered by Kevin Bacon - he said that he believes that he has worked with the most diverse range of actors in hollywood.\r\n\r\nFrom that, people decided to put him to the test, and a game was devised. Whilst the origin for the rules of the game are based on garbage (the old '6 degrees of seperation' idea, which itself was based on fatally flawed data)\r\n\r\n### The Rules\r\nThe rules are as follows:\r\n\r\n2 or more people attempt to link 2 random actors/actresses, linking them through other actors that they have worked with.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the 2 random actors/actresses were:\r\n\r\nAngelia Jolie & Kevin Costner\r\n\r\nOne solution would be:\r\n```\r\nAngelina Jolie & Brad Pitt - Mr & Mrs Smith\r\nBrad Pitt & Christian Slater - Interview with a Vampire\r\nChristian Slater & Kevin Costner - Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\r\n```\r\nThat would give you a score of **3**, or you have done it in 3 links. Normally the game is limited to 6 links, but that is down to personal choice - sometimes it is easier to allow more links when you first start playing the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Maths\r\n\r\nBased on the conservative average that an actor has starred in 25 films,\r\nand each film has featured 25 actors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe start with 1 actor,\r\nwho has starred in 25 films,\r\nwhich have starred 625 actors,\r\nwho have starred in 15,625 films,\r\nwhich have starred 390,625 actors,\r\nwho have starred in 9,765,625 films,\r\nwhich have starred 244,140,625 actors,\r\nwho have starred in 6,103,515,625 films,\r\nwhich have starred 152,587,890,625 actors,\r\nwho have starred in 3,814,697,265,625 films,\r\nwhich have starred 95,367,431,640,625 actors,\r\nwho have starred in 2,384,185,791,015,620 films.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives us 2,384,185,791,015,620 possible combinations from 1 actor to another at 6 levels.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the mathematics VERY quickly spiral out of control.  Note that this is a purely statistical calculation, and does not take into account that actors may have worked with each other multiple times, nor does it take into account the actual number of films made by Hollywood - it is purely the number of possible combinations (I think.)\r\n\r\n\r\n","name":"Kevinbacon","tagline":"","google":""}
